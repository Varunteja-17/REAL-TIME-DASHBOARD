## ⏱️ Task 3: Real-Time Dashboard Using Streaming Data

### 📌 Objective

Create a **real-time dashboard** in Power BI using streaming data from Microsoft Azure, REST API, or simulated sources.

> **Deliverable**: A dynamic dashboard in Power BI that simulates or reflects live data updates.

This task highlights Power BI’s ability to visualize **real-time insights**, crucial in fields like finance, supply chain, IoT, and digital marketing.

## 🧪 Data Simulation Strategy

Live APIs were unavailable, so a **manual streaming method** was implemented using Excel data. The data was modified to simulate metrics like:

- `Hyderabad` regional data
- `Column5` performance numbers
- Time-stamped events for line and pie charts

---

## 🧾 Dataset & Fields

Multiple Excel tables were imported and evaluated:

- **Table 1**: Core metrics (Sales/Region)
- **Table 2**: Category & time breakdown
- **Table 3**: Evaluation-related fields

**Key Fields:**

- `Hyderabad`, `Column5`, `Column2`, `Column4`, `Column6`, `Time`

---

## ⚙️ Dashboard Features

- Imported 3 tables and applied transformation logic
- Used slicers and filters for interactivity
- Integrated multiple visualization types to reflect insights dynamically

---

## 📊 Visuals Created

- 📊 **Bar Chart**: Hyderabad & Column5 by `Column2`
- 🕒 **Pie Chart**: Time-based Hyderabad distribution
- 📈 **Area Chart**: Line chart showing hourly trends
- 🧮 **Stacked Column**: Multi-dimensional Column5 analysis
- 🔢 **KPI Tiles**: Quick summaries and metric cards

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Designed and published simulated **real-time dashboards**
- Gained practical experience in **data modeling** and **DAX**
- Used **Power BI visuals** to translate numbers into business insights
- Simulated a push-data scenario without an actual streaming source

---

## 💡 Observations

- Power BI can simulate near-live dashboards using Excel or APIs
- Streaming visuals (like real-time lines) work only on dashboards (not in reports)
- Slicers and filters improve clarity and allow user-specific insights

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This project enhanced my ability to build real-time, responsive dashboards. I learned how to simulate real-time environments, connect data models, and configure professional-level reports – a valuable skill for any data enthusiast or BI developer.
